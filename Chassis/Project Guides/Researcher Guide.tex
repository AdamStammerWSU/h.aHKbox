\begin{abstract}
This document is intended to help guide future researchers in their research and development of the Hardware.astronomy House Keeping Box. I began working on this project in the summer of 2019, under the direction of Dr. Carl Ferkinhoff, at Winona State University. This guide summarizes some of the thought processes and plans that went into this project, the tools and softwares used in its development, and gives tips on mistakes made and lessons learned.

\section{Overview of Project}
This is section 1.
\newline
This is the second paragraph of section 1. You can see an equation down below

\begin{equation}
\frac{Step_{time}}{Period} = Step_{duty}
\end{equation}



Here is an inline equation $\frac{1\mu s}{10\mu s} = 10\%$.

\section{The Second Section}
This is section 2. Below you can see a picture. 

\section*{Unnumbered Section}
This is section 3.

% The numeral (here 99) in curly braces is nominally the number of entries in
% the bibliography. It's supposed to affect the amount of space around the
% numerical labels, so only the number of digits should matter--and even that
% seems to make no discernible difference.
